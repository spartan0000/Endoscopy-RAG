### A few days ago, I was sitting in a meeting where we were discussing a way to sift through patient data and properly triage their colonoscopy follow up based on their endoscopy data and histology from any polyps that were removed.  The suggestion was that this should be done manually.
### I mentioned that we could use an LLM to help with this by using RAG and entering our protocols into a vector database for retrieval.

### People jokingly suggested I build such a system over the weekend...
### So I did.  It's a very basic prototype but as a proof of concept, it works

### This is the easy part.  The hard part will be convincing the powers that be (high inertia, highly risk averse) that we should try to implement this

### Either way, it was fun experimenting with this over the weekend!
### More refinements and updates to come...improving the protocol documents, logging and auditing, benchmarks and accuracy
