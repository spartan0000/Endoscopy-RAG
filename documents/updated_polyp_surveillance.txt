INTRODUCTION

Te Aho o Te Kahu, the Cancer Control Agency (TAoTK) in partnership with the National
Screening Unit, Ministry of Health (the Ministry) endorses this advice on surveillance
colonoscopy for follow-up after removal of polyps. This advice sets out appropriate
practice for clinicians to follow subject to their own judgement. It has been developed to
help them make decisions in this area.
The advice was developed to align with recent publications from the United Kingdom,
the United States, Australia and Europe (Cancer Council Australia Surveillance
Colonoscopy Guidelines Working Party 2019; Gupta, Lieberman et al 2020; Hassan,
Antonelli et al 2020; Rutter, East et al 2020). These publications, based on updated
available evidence up to June 2019, indicated that previous guidelines would now
recommend over surveillance for some groups.
A technical advisory group with the required expertise was established and has
undertaken a systematic review of recent literature. Members of the group included a
range of clinicians and some members of the National Bowel Cancer Working Group
(NBCWG). Their role was to review the evidence and consider implementation of a
similar polyp follow-up approach in New Zealand.
The New Zealand specialists in the technical advisory group are routinely involved in the
diagnosis, management and surveillance of patients identified to have bowel polyps.

Ensuring an equity focus is a priority for TAoTK and the Ministry. Evidence indicates that
Māori are less likely to have access to early diagnosis for some cancers, including
colorectal cancers, than non-Māori. Breaking down barriers for Māori to access
surveillance colonoscopy will allow a greater proportion of cancers to be detected early
and managed well, leading to more curative treatment and subsequent improvements in
survival for Māori patients.
Note: This document is updating only the polyp surveillance section of the previous
guidelines. An update on other aspects will also be developed. New Zealand
colonoscopy capacity is constrained, and we anticipate that these guidelines will reduce
demand.

PURPOSE OF THIS ADVICE

The main purpose of this document is to provide recommendations for surveillance
after colonoscopy and complete removal of adenomas and serrated polyps. The
recommendations are the same for initial and subsequent procedures and may, if
appropriate, be applied to colonoscopy procedures that have been completed before
we released this guidance.
Patients outside the scope of this advice are those with hereditary colorectal cancer
syndromes (for example, Lynch syndrome or Familial Adenomatous Polyposis),
inflammatory bowel disease, personal history of colorectal cancer, and family history
that warrants investigation for hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes (Ministry of
Health 2012).

AUDIENCE FOR THESE
GUIDELINES

This advice is relevant to clinicians providing colorectal polyp surveillance. All district
health boards, whether or not they have begun to participate in the National Bowel
Screening Programme, are expected to offer colonoscopic polyp surveillance in line with
this advice.

EQUITY

Survival outcomes for colorectal cancer are significantly poorer for Māori than for non-
Māori. Comorbidity and difficulties with accessing health services for colon cancer

account for about 30 percent of excess mortality among Māori (Hill, Sarfati, et al 2010).
Māori and Pacific peoples are also more likely to be diagnosed with advanced disease at
diagnosis of colorectal cancer and, significantly, are more likely to be diagnosed after
they present at an emergency department, which may reflect poorer access to primary
and secondary services (Health Quality & Safety Commission New Zealand 2017). For this
reason, it is important that clinicians make decisions that contribute to equitable
outcomes for Māori and Pacific peoples in particular. However, surveillance intervals are
determined by the biology of premalignant polyps. There is no evidence that adenomas
and serrated polyps grow faster in Māori and Pacific peoples.

NOTES ON CLINICAL
CONTEXT

High-quality colonoscopy is the prerequisite for these recommendations. To be of high
quality, the colonoscopy must involve verified and documented caecal intubation, good
colonoscopy technique and adequate bowel preparation (see ‘Definitions’ below).
Surveillance should be adjusted for suboptimal colonoscopy.
Recommended techniques for polypectomy should be followed and complete polyp
excision should be performed (see ‘Definitions’ below).

POLYP RISK CATEGORIES

Table 2: Polyp risk categories

Conventional adenomas Serrated polyps

Average-risk
polyps

Tubular adenomas < 10 mm Sessile serrated lesion (SSA/P) < 10 mm
Hyperplastic polyp ≥ 10 mm*

High-risk
polyps

Adenoma ≥ 10 mm**
Adenoma with tubulovillous
or villous histology**
Adenoma with high-grade
dysplasia**

Sessile serrated lesion (SSA/P) ≥ 10 mm
Sessile serrated lesion (SSA/P) with dysplasia
Traditional serrated adenoma
Serrated adenoma, unclassified (unclassified
serrated polyp with dysplasia)
* Follow up as a high-risk polyp if concern exists about consistency in distinction between sessile
serrated lesion and hyperplastic polyp locally.
** Advanced adenoma defined as: 10 mm or larger in size or 25% or greater villous histology (that is,
tubulovillous or villous adenoma) or high-grade dysplasia.
After piecemeal resection of polyps equal to or greater than 20 mm in size, the site
should be checked within two to six months and then a further full colonoscopy
performed after an additional 12 months. Once no recurrence is confirmed patients
should undergo post polypectomy surveillance after a further interval of three years.
The need for further surveillance should then be determined in accordance with this
update and individual risk factors.
No surveillance is required for anyone who has only hyperplastic polyps smaller than
10 mm, unless the person meets the criteria for Serrated Polyposis Syndrome.

POLYP SURVEILLANCE
GUIDANCE 2024

Figure 1 summarises the new guidance after complete removal of adenomas and
serrated polyps. This advice was developed in recognition of the:
1. low risk of future colorectal cancer for some groups of patients identified as
having adenomas
2. colorectal cancer risk associated with some serrated polyps.

Figure 1. Surveillance intervals based on findings at high-quality colonoscopy:
summary of figure 1 in text - If there are greater than or equal to 10 adenomas, the patient should have follow up colonoscopy in 1 year.  If the patient has been diagnosed with sessile serrated polyposis syndrome, once they have a colonoscopy with complete clearance of polyps meaning there is documentation that no further polyps were seen on the most recent colonoscopy, they should have another colonoscoyp in 1 year.

If the patient has 5-9 adenomas that are less than 10mm in size, or a single adenoma greater than or equal to 10mm in size, or any tubulovillous or villous adenoma or any adenoma with high grade dysplasia, they need another colonoscopy in 3 years.  In patients with serrated polyps on histology, if they have greater than or equal to 5 polyps that are all less than 10mm in size or any sessile serrated polyp that is greater than or equal to 10mm in size, or any sessile serrated polyp with dysplasia or any serrated adenoma, they need a follow up colonoscopy in 3 years.

If a patient has 3-4 adenomas without any of the high risk features noted above and all of the adenomas are less than 10mm in size, they need a follow up colonoscopy in 5 years.  For patients with serrated polyps, if they have 1-4 sessile serrated polyps that are all less than 10mm in size or a hyperplastic polyp that is greater than or equal to 10mm in size, they need a follow up colonoscopy in 5 years.

If a patient has 1-2 adenomas that are all less than 10mm in size, they need a follow up colonoscopy in 10 years or at an age when they are eligible for National Bowel Screening Program, whichever comes first.


* If there are both adenoma <10mm and SSL <10 mm, sum up the numbers and apply follow-up
interval for SSL.
** A three-year follow-up interval is favoured if concern about consistency in distinction between
sessile serrated lesion and hyperplastic polyp locally.
*** Consider referral to the NZ Familial Gastrointestinal Cancer Service (NZFGCS). Referral criteria for
multiple adenoma and Serrated Polyposis Syndrome to NZFGCS are provided below.

NBSP: National Bowel Screening Programme
SSL: Sessile serrated lesion (=sessile serrated adenoma/polyp)
HGD: High grade dysplasia
HP: Hyperplastic polyp
For people older than age 75 years or with significant comorbidities, carefully consider
potential benefits and risks before offering any routine surveillance.
This advice needs to be interpreted taking the patient’s family history of bowel cancer
into account.
Surveillance colonoscopy should only be performed in people whose life expectancy is
> 10 years and therefore generally not in people older than 75 years.

DEFINITIONS

High-quality colonoscopy
The decision on future surveillance can only be made if the colonoscopy was of
sufficient quality.
A full description of what constitutes the expected good practice is described in the
Standards for Individuals Performing BSP colonoscopy (Endoscopy Governance Group
for New Zealand 2017).
The basic principles include:
1. The colonoscopy is performed by a credentialed colonoscopist, as defined by the
Endoscopy Guidance Group for New Zealand (Endoscopy Guidance Group for New
Zealand 2018).
a. The bowel preparation is sufficiently clear, defined as both a; Boston Bowel
Preparation Score (BBPS) on withdrawal of 6 or higher, with no single
segment score under 2.
b. Subjective rating of Excellent or Adequate (the top two categories on the
drop-down menu from Provation).

2. There is photo documentation of caecal intubation and retro flexion in the
rectum.

High-quality polypectomy
Endoscopic polypectomy should ensure complete removal of all neoplastic tissue.
Polyp size should be measured using the width of a snare (Gupta, Lieberman, et al 2020).
Morphology of the polyp should be assessed using the PARIS classification and the pit
pattern interpreted using virtual or chromoendoscopy.
Removal of polyps assessed to be difficult (e.g. by the Size, Morphology, Site and Access
criteria) which includes those larger than 2cm should be considered for deferring for an
appropriately experienced and skilled (Level 4) endoscopist.
The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy’s 2017 clinical guideline is the
current best-practice guideline for performing colonoscopic polypectomy of different
morphology, size and location (Endoscopy Governance Group for New Zealand 2017;
Ferlitsch, Moss, et al 2017; Sidhu, Tate, et al 2018).

Boston Bowel Preparation Scale
The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) is a scale that describes the quality of bowel
preparation at colonoscopy. The large bowel is divided into three sections: the right
colon, the transverse colon (including flexures) and the left colon with rectum. Each
section is scored individually from 0–3 (Rosty, Brosens et al 2019).  0 = Unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot
be cleared.  1 = Portion of mucosa of the colon segment seen, but other areas of the colon
segment not well seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid.  2 = Minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid,
but mucosa of colon segment seen well.  3 = Entire mucosa of colon segment seen well with no residual staining, small
fragments of stool or opaque liquid.
These segment scores are summed for a total BBPS score ranging from 0–9.

Serrated Polyposis Syndrome
The updated World Health Organization criteria for diagnosis are:  Criterion 1: At least 5 serrated polyps proximal to the rectum all ≥5 mm, with at least
two ≥10 mm.  Criterion 2: More than 20 serrated polyps of any size but distributed throughout the
large bowel, with at least 5 proximal to the rectum (Dekker, Bleijenberg, et al 2020).
Any histologic subtype of serrated polyp is included in the final count. The diagnosis
may require more than one colonoscopy and the polyp count is cumulative over time.

REFERRAL CRITERIA TO THE
NEW ZEALAND FAMILIAL
GASTROINTESTINAL CANCER
SERVICE

Note: These are referral guidelines. A hereditary cause underlying polyposis
correlates to some extent with the age your patient meets the criteria stated
below. If you have additional concerns about your patient, you may want to
refer outside these criteria. There are separate guidelines for individuals with a
family/whanau history of polyposis/CRC.

Serrated Polyposis Syndrome
Refer a patient to the New Zealand Familial Gastrointestinal Cancer Service where they
meet the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria for a diagnosis of SPS and have one of
the below features:  Age ≤ 30 yrs  Personal history of colorectal cancer ≤ 50 yrs  First degree relative with CRC ≤ 50yrs or SPS diagnosed ≤ 50yrs  Failing endoscopic management of polyposis and this group includes patients with
multiple dysplastic SSPs.  10 cumulative adenomas and a diagnosis of SPS.
Please see the NZFGCS website link for further information regarding
management of SPS including family/whanau recommendation.

Multiple adenoma
Refer a patient to the New Zealand Familial Gastrointestinal Cancer Service where they
have: • 20 cumulative adenomas, or • 10 cumulative adenomas if the patient is aged 30 years or younger, or • 10 cumulative adenomas and a diagnosis of CRC, or • 10 cumulative adenomas and a diagnosis of SPS, or • Family history of colorectal cancer in a number of first degree relative’s or
diagnosed under age 50 years.

UPDATE ON POLYP GUIDELINES 2024 11
A concerning family history of CRC or polyposis should prompt consideration of referral
outside these criteria.
In some cases outside this above stated referral criteria for multiple colorectal
adenoma, there may be suggested family/whanau recommendations that apply
to your patients’ relatives. Please see the NZ Familial GI Cancer Service website
for details https://www.nzfgcs.co.nz/.
