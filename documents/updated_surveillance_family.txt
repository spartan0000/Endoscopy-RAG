Background
In 2012, the New Zealand Guidelines Group published an evidence-based best practice
guideline outlining surveillance and management of groups at increased risk of colorectal
cancer (CRC) due to their personal history and family/whānau history.1
Specifically, the 2012 guidelines contained recommendations for the following groups:
• Surveillance recommendations: Personal history of colorectal diseases
• Personal history: Colorectal adenomas
• Personal history: Inflammatory bowel disease
• Surveillance recommendations: Family/Whānau history of colorectal cancer
• Category 1: Slightly above-average risk
• Category 2: Moderately increased risk
• Category 3: Potentially high risk

Purpose
The purpose of this document is to update the 2012 NZ Guidelines Group surveillance
recommendations for the second broad group: individuals with a family/whānau history
of colorectal cancer. This update brings the guidelines into line with recent international
guidance and with the change in New Zealand now that we have completed the rollout of
the National Bowel Screening Programme (NBSP) and initiated the lowering of the age of
eligibility for Māori and Pacific people from 60 to 50 years. This document is intended for
patients currently on ongoing colonoscopy surveillance as well as those who will have
surveillance in the future.
It is noted that although these recommendations are comprehensive, there will be some
clinical scenarios that are not explicitly outlined and should therefore be managed by
clinicians using the underlying principles outlined in this document.
This update is designed to dovetail with the Update on Polyp Surveillance Guidelines
2020, published by Te Aho o Te Kahu, the Cancer Control Agency in partnership with the
Ministry of Health.2
Surveillance recommendations for those with personal history of colorectal cancer and
inflammatory bowel disease are outside the scope of this update.

Committee
The committee that developed this document worked under the National Bowel Cancer
Working Group, which is co-hosted by the National Screening Unit, Te Whatu Ora andTe
Aho o Te Kahu, the Cancer Control Agency.
The committee members are:
• Ian Bissett, colorectal surgeon (Chair)
• Susan Parry, gastroenterologist
• Rowan French, general surgeon
• Sze-Lin Peng, colorectal surgeon
• Zoe Raos, gastroenterologist
• Teresa Chalmers-Watson, gastroenterologist.

Category 1: Individuals with
a slightly above-average
risk of CRC
Individuals in this category have one first-degree relative diagnosed with colorectal cancer
at or over the age of 55 years.

Recommendations
• Strongly advise these individuals to participate in the NBSP when they become
eligible.
• Individuals should make healthy lifestyle choices3 and report any bowel symptoms to
their health care provider.
• Previously, there were no specific surveillance recommendations for this group.

Category 2: Individuals with
a moderately increased risk
of CRC
Individuals in this category have:
• one first-degree relative diagnosed with CRC under the age of 55 years, or
• two first-degree relatives on the same side of the family/whānau diagnosed with CRC
at any age (without any of the potential high-risk features in Category 3).

Recommendations
• Individuals have a colonoscopy every five years from age 50, or from an age 10 years
before the earliest age at which colorectal cancer was diagnosed in the family/whānau,
whichever comes first.
• Provided they have had a high-quality colonoscopy within the previous five years,
individuals then participate in the NBSP from the age of 60 years.
• If aged over 60 years and the previous surveillance colonoscopy documented polyps
that require further colonoscopy surveillance, continue with this surveillance in line with
the Update on Polyp Surveillance Guidelines 2020.

4 When colonoscopy surveillance is

no longer indicated, return these individuals to the NBSP.
• Individuals should make healthy lifestyle choices5 and report any bowel symptoms to
their health care provider.
• All the above recommendations apply to Māori and Pacific people in this category,
even though the age of eligibility for participating in the NBSP has been lowered from
60 to 50 years for Māori and Pacific (i.e. Māori and Pacific continue their colonoscopic
surveillance until 60 years rather joining NBSP at 50 years).

Category 3: Individuals with
a potentially high risk of
CRC
Individuals in this category have one or more of the following:
• a family/whānau history of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Lynch syndrome or
other familial CRC syndromes
• one first-degree relative plus two or more first- or second-degree relatives all on the
same side of the family/whānau with a diagnosis of CRC at any age
• two first-degree relatives, or one first-degree relative plus one or more second-degree
relatives, all on the same side of the family/whānau with a diagnosis of CRC, and one
such relative:
• was diagnosed with CRC when aged 54 years or under, or
• developed two or more bowel cancers, or
• developed an extracolonic tumour suggestive of Lynch syndrome (ie, endometrial,
ovarian, stomach, small bowel, renal pelvis, pancreas or brain)
• a first-degree relative with CRC diagnosed under the age of 50, where colorectal
tumour immunohistochemistry has revealed loss of protein expression for one of the
mismatch repair genes (ie, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2) and further testing (BRAF
or methylation) raises the possibility of Lynch syndrome
• at least one first- or second-degree family/whānau member diagnosed with CRC in
association with multiple bowel polyps (10 or more adenomas at one time or 5 or more
advanced adenomas at one time, or 20 cumulative adenomas, 10 cumulative
adenomas if the patient is aged 30 years or younger) or a polyposis syndrome
• a first-degree relative with multiple colonic polyps (10 or more adenomas at one time
or 5 or more advanced adenomas at one time, or 20 cumulative adenomas, or 10
cumulative adenomas if the relative is aged 30 years or younger).

Recommendations
• Refer individuals either to the New Zealand Familial GI Cancer Service (NZFGCS) or
to a genetic service for an accurate risk assessment.

Update on Surveillance Recommendations for Individuals
with a Family/Whānau History of Colorectal Cancer 9
• Follow the colonoscopy surveillance plan advised by the NZFGCS, genetic service or
bowel cancer specialist.
• Individuals should make healthy lifestyle choices6 and report any bowel symptoms to
their health care provider.
